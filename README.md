# Flight prices prediction

The goal of the project is to predict when is the best time to buy an aircraft ticket in order to get the lowest price. In the recent decade, there has been steady increase in number of travels by airway. Millions of people all over the world take flights each day. However, ticket prices vary unexpectedly, sometimes drastically. Depending on various factors like supply-demand, airline increases or decreases fare prices on day to day basis to boost their revenue. But for a commoner, itâ€™s hard to make an estimate of optimal time to buy air tickets considering his lack of sufficient information. Therefore, there is scope for a task to compute if a given time is the best time for a purchase (i.e.  now or wait till certain time when it is expected to drop the lowest) .
